# XO with AI

This project combines the power of **Flutter** for the UI and **Flask** for the backend, offering an exciting experience of playing the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** (XO) game against a smart AI opponent. Test your skills and see if you can outsmart the AI in this interactive game!

## How it Works

- **Flutter**: The user interface (UI) is built using Flutter, providing a smooth and responsive experience for mobile devices.
- **Flask**: The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework that handles the AI logic.
- **AI Algorithm**: The AI uses the **Minimax** algorithm to make decisions. It builds a game tree, evaluates each possible move, and selects the best one based on a heuristic approach.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Run the Flask Backend**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the backend by executing the following command:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

2. **Run the Flutter Frontend**:
   - In a separate terminal, navigate to the Flutter project folder.
   - Run the Flutter app with the following command:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

Enjoy playing against the AI and challenge yourself to outsmart it!
